Japanese Character Quiz is an interactive web app designed to help users learn and reinforce their knowledge of Hiragana and Katakana, the two main phonetic writing systems in Japanese.

Users can choose specific sets of characters to focus on, including:

Basic syllables (e.g. あ, か, さ)
Dakuten variants (e.g. が, ざ, だ)
Combination sounds (e.g. きゃ, しゃ, ちゃ)
The app then presents randomized prompts, and users input the corresponding romaji (Latin alphabet) reading. The app provides instant feedback, highlighting correct and incorrect responses, along with the correct answer when necessary.

Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and React, this project is a minimal, responsive tool that helps learners build reading fluency through repetition and active recall.
